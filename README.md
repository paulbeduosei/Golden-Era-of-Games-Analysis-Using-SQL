# Golden-Era-of-Games-Analysis-Using-SQL
A really fun SQL project exploring whether we can actually identify a “golden age” of video games 🎮📊
Using critic scores, user scores, and global sales data for the top 400 games released since 1977, I joined datasets, filtered release years, compared trends, and even used set operations to find which years gamers and critics agreed on the most.

The goal was to blend data + storytelling:

✨ Which years produced the highest-rated games?

✨ Do critics and users agree?

✨ Are the most beloved games also the ones that sold the most?

✨ And is gaming truly getting better, or did we already peak?

This project made me appreciate how much SQL can uncover hidden patterns, even in something fun like video game history. And honestly… analyzing games for a project? That’s my kind of work-life balance 😄🎮
